      An excellent idea my fellow mod, and I made an account just for being full admin to be more secure (It would be better than mod anyway). Please give me privelidges.

      By the way, prankers. Once I become admin you will be hit not with the ban hammer, but the BANBERD, a halberd for BANNING people... savor your last moments now.

      Sorry my computer is bugged, lol.... um... looks like the admin panel isn't working lol... I can't give you privileges... Sorry you won't be able to be mod or admin.

      It's nice having you comment though :3

      As for the phone calls...

      Umm XD Your old posts are up there with the phone number still.

      Are you saying I should delete my posts?

      I may worship you as a mod,

      but that's too far even for me.

      As for your computer, worry not, I can fix it.

      I have my way with computers... calculators want to kiss me. Laptops love me. With a flick of my wing, your computer will sing.

      Sorry for the lack of posting. I accidentally deleted Minecrap and it took all day to figure out how to get it to work again.

      Fortunately the prank caller helped me get it back and now we are playing together.

      If anyone else wants to play I'm putting the details of our server below:
